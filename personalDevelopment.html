  <p> At the Girls & Boys Club, we try to offer programs to fill the gaps that are not being addressed in many inner-city public schools. We offer volunteer-led classes in a number of fields, including:  </p>
  <p> Smart Girls - A health, fitness, prevention/education and self-esteem enhancement program for girls ages 8 to 17.</p>
  <p> Triple Play - Emphasizes good nutrition, regular physical activity, and improving overall well-being.</p>
  <p> Goals For Graduation - Designed to enhance Club members√≠ engagement with learning by providing consistent support from caring and trusted adults in developing the academic, emotional and social skills needed to achieve academic success.
 </p>
  <p> Money Matters - Promotes financial responsibility and independence among Club members. Participants learn how to manage a checking account, create a budget, save and invest, and pay for college. </p>
  <p> Image Makers - Encourages Club members to learn about black-and-white, color, digital and alternative process photography. The ImageMakers National Photography Program Resource Guide is full of fun, creative activity ideas</p>
